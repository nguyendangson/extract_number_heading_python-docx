In python-docx package https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx, as I know, you cannot extract number headings of chapters, sections like 1.1, 1.2,... so I create the python function to extract them.

Input: your path of docx files

Output: a list including number headings and name headings of docx files

Please start by "git clone https://github.com/nguyendangson/extract_number_heading_python-docx.git"
Then in powershell, please run "pip install -r requirements.tx" to install python-docx or you can install python-docx by running "pip install python-docx"
